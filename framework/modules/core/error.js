 * @class
 *
 * The root object for Error objects
 *
 * M.Error encapsulates errors in The-M-Project.
 * Should be passed to error callbacks.
 *
 * 0-99:    general errors
 *
 * 100-199: Model and Validation errors
 *
 * 200-299:   WebSQL errors
 *
 * 300-400:   CouchDB errors
 *
 *
 * Constant                             Code    Situation
 * --------                             ----    ---------
 * M.CONST.ERROR.UNDEFINED                      0       The reason for the error could not be clarified.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.CONNECTION                     1       A connection to an external service could not be established
 *
 * M.CONST.ERROR.VALIDATION_PRESENCE            100     A model record failed validation due to a property is not set but required to be.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.VALIDATION_URL                 101     A model record failed validation due to a property does not represent a valid URL but is required to do so.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.VALIDATION_PHONE               102     A model record failed validation due to a property does not represent a phone number but is required to do so.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.VALIDATION_NUMBER              103     A model record failed validation due to a property is not of type number or represents a number but is required to do so.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.VALIDATION_NOTMINUS            104     A model record failed validation due to a property contains a minus value but it is required to do not.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.VALIDATION_EMAIL               105     A model record failed validation due to a property does not represent a valid eMail but is required to do so.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.VALIDATION_DATE                106     A model record failed validation due to a property does not represent a valid date but is required to do so.
 *
 * M.CONST.ERROR.MODEL_PROVIDER_NOT_SET         120     A data provider has not been set.
 *
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_UNKNOWN                 200     The transaction failed for reasons unrelated to the database itself and not covered by any other error code.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_DATABASE                201     The statement failed for database reasons not covered by any other error code.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_VERSION                 202     The operation failed because the actual database version was not what it should be. For example, a statement found that the actual database version no longer matched the expected version of the Database or DatabaseSync object, or the Database.changeVersion() or DatabaseSync.changeVersion() methods were passed a version that doesn't match the actual database version.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_TOO_LARGE               203     The statement failed because the data returned from the database was too large. The SQL "LIMIT" modifier might be useful to reduce the size of the result set.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_QUOTA                   204     The statement failed because there was not enough remaining storage space, or the storage quota was reached and the user declined to give more space to the database.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_SYNTAX                  205     The statement failed because of a syntax error, or the number of arguments did not match the number of ? placeholders in the statement, or the statement tried to use a statement that is not allowed, such as BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK, or the statement tried to use a verb that could modify the database but the transaction was read-only.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_CONSTRAINT              206     An INSERT, UPDATE, or REPLACE statement failed due to a constraint failure. For example, because a row was being inserted and the value given for the primary key column duplicated the value of an existing row.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_TIMEOUT                 207     A lock for the transaction could not be obtained in a reasonable time.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_PROVIDER_NO_DBHANDLER   208     No DBHandler, initialization did not take place or failed.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.WEBSQL_BULK_NO_RECORDS         210     No Records given for bulk transaction
 *
 * M.CONST.ERROR.COUCHDB_CONFLICT               300     A conflict occured while saving a document in CouchDB, propably caused by duplicate IDs
 * M.CONST.ERROR.COUCHDB_DBNOTFOUND             301     The provided database could not be found.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.COUCHDB_DBEXISTS               302     The db already exists and therefor cannot be created again.
 * M.CONST.ERROR.COUCHDB_DOCNOTFOUND            303     No document was found for the provided ID in the database.
